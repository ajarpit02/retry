Overview of Functions in Java and JavaScript
==========================================

1. Java Functions (Methods)
---------------------------

In Java, functions are commonly referred to as methods. They are blocks of code that perform a specific task and are always defined inside a class.

Key Characteristics:
- Java is a statically typed language.
- Methods must have a return type (or void).
- Methods belong to classes or objects.
- Method overloading is supported.

Basic Syntax:
returnType methodName(parameters) {
    // method body
}

Example:
public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

Types of Methods:
- Static Methods: Belong to the class (static keyword).
- Instance Methods: Belong to an object.
- Abstract Methods: Declared without implementation.
- Final Methods: Cannot be overridden.

Method Parameters:
- Passed by value (object references are passed by value of reference).

2. JavaScript Functions
-----------------------

In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

Key Characteristics:
- JavaScript is dynamically typed.
- Functions can be declared in multiple ways.
- Functions can be anonymous.
- Supports closures.

Function Declaration:
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

Function Expression:
const add = function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
};

Arrow Function (ES6):
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

Types of Functions:
- Named Functions
- Anonymous Functions
- Arrow Functions
- Callback Functions
- Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

Special Features:
- Functions can access variables from outer scopes (closures).
- Default parameters and rest parameters are supported.

3. Key Differences Between Java and JavaScript Functions
---------------------------------------------------------

- Java requires explicit data types; JavaScript does not.
- Java methods are part of classes; JavaScript functions can exist independently.
- Java supports method overloading at compile time; JavaScript does not (last definition wins).
- JavaScript functions are more flexible due to dynamic typing.

Conclusion:
-----------
Java functions focus on structure, type safety, and object-oriented design.
JavaScript functions emphasize flexibility, functional programming, and runtime behavior.
